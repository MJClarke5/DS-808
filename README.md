DS 808 Optimation Methods II Project

Project Guidelines:

Throughout the term we saw several examples where we used optimization (and some
simulation) techniques to model and solve decision problems. The course project is meant for
you to explore how techniques from this class can be applied to a problem that you personally
find interesting (maybe relevant to your current/prior work). You can approach your project in
either one of the following two ways:

  • Research: Searching in the literature for existing optimization or simulation models
  that have been developed for that problem (preferably in academic papers), and
  then describing at least one of those models in detail (e.g., going through the list of
  variables, objective function, and constraints, and some results).
  • Applied: Rolling up your sleeves and developing an optimization or simulation
  model for that problem on your own, and then presenting your model & results.
  (Your model doesn’t have to be too complicated or perfect. It could resemble one of
  the models we see among class examples, and/or it could be implemented for a
  small instance of the real problem you are considering).
